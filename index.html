										<h3>PUBLIC POLICY PROPOSAL ON TOKENIZATION</h3>
										<p>LEVERAGING BLOCKCHAIN FOR NIGERIA DEBT SETTLEMENT
											Mr President, luckily for this great country of ours; Nigeria happens to be one of the most geological lottery winners to ever exist the planet earth with numerous solid and liquid natural resources sitting under 90 million hectares of land today. Without a doubt we are one of the richest in Africa if estimated by the value of our natural resource endowment.
											For any country to gain self-sufficiency status, in other words to achieve economic growth and economic development, she must be able to earn enough revenue known to us as GDP (gross domestic product) to cater for its capital and recurrent expenditure. The excess of that is what we save for rainy days.
											Nigeria today is at a national public debt level of over $46 billion with an unfavourable term of trade and balance of payment position. 
											I believe there is a solution to our current economic position and the solution is using what we have to get what we need.
											
											What do we have? You ask! Mr President?
											
											What we have always had ----- our natural resources
											With our natural resources like GOLD, EMERALDS, SAPPHIRES, RUBIES, AQUAMINES, TOURMALINE, TOPAZ, GARNET, ZIRCON, AMETHYST, PERIDOT, OIL AND MORE.
											With the help of technology (BLOCKCHAIN AND TOKENIZATION) our total debt shall be settled by 2030. We will also have enough left to provide the necessary infrastructure to drive economic development.
											The key solution for our economy overhaul is technology and that technology is leveraging blockchain technology through tokenization.
											Mr President, we are at the brink of a new financial world; the past 100 years had us been stifled by a few nations who had us at an advantage through colonization and financial oppression… but no more. 
											Mr, President, The internet brought about the free movement of information to everyone regardless of your location in the early 90s; 25years later, the internet is now providing the frictionless movement and exchange of value (both fixed Asset and current asset) between central banks, commercial banks, non- financial institutions and individuals regardless of your geographical location in the world. This giant stride is being made possible by blockchain technology through the concept of tokenization.
											Value as we know it in the world today is transitioning to a digital space, all the assets in the world is valued at $1.2 Quadrillion eg cash, debt, stocks, real estate, oil, all precious metals and more as well as liabilities will be tokenized on a blockchain which will become a liquidity pool on which the whole world will transact going forward. The world bank, bank of international settlement and the central bank of the G7 countries all signed giving the order for all central banks to create their CBDC before November 2025. This directive was given to end the era of central banks parking over $27 Trillion around the world in nostro vostro accounts for cross boarder payments in compliance with the IS20022 Global financial standards.
											
											Mr President, before I go further, I would like to clarify the concept of tokenization.
											Tokenization is the concept of converting all Nigeria’s real-world assets like oil, gold, stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, natural gas, all precious stones and more into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent the ownership rights to all the underlying Assets.  The natural resources like gold does not need to be explored or mined  for valuation or ownership to be ascertained. With the use of recent advanced satellite technology, the volume and density of these resources can be ascertained from space while valuation is achieved  through the engagement of qualified and auditors and valuers.
											Tokenization enables the opportunity to refine the way Nigeria’s real and natural resources are monetized and converted into financial assets. By tokenizing our resources, we will be making our resources accessible to a wide range of investors globally
											Through the digitizing of our assets on the blockchain, Nigeria will become a global liquidity provider hence facilitating the quick and easy payment of our public debt.
											Tokenization fosters the efficient transfer of the property ownership rights, enhance liquidity and clear transparency in the investing process. It will attract global investors, foster economic growth and economjc development.
											
											Mr President, I can hear you ask… when we digitize our assets on the blockchain, what are we worth?
											
											I will kindly like to answer that question with a two word answer… A LOT!!
											
											NIGERIA’S GOLD ASSET VALUATION FOR DIGITIZING
											1.	GOLD –   Nigeria’s gold deposits were estimated in January 2022 at around 200 million ounces. However, it is of note to say that the value would have changed due to continuous mining activities between 2022 and 2024. At a conservative stand, an ounce of gold is estimated at a range between $1800 to $2000 per ounce; that gives us an estimation of over $360billion. NOTE; this valuation stands even when the gold is not escavated from the ground so long they remain in our ownership domain.
											Remember Mr President, our total debt as at Q2 2023 was at $46 Billion according to the National bureau of statistics.
											With the nation’s gold reserves alone, our total debt is dissolved.
											
											We will also have more than enough to provide all the infrastructure we need for progressive growth and development to becoming a first world nation
											
											Mr President, without further delay; I would request for a discussion with your office for the commencement of the public-private  partnerships required for a smooth and rapid asset digitization process and I also hereby declare my interest in acting in the capacity of an executive player and contributor to this national economic change process with the authority and consent of your office.
											
											I see a greater Nigeria
											The land is more greener on this side
											Our time of bountiful harvest is here
											
											God bless the federal republic of Nigeria
